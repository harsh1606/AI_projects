# ðŸ¤– AI Projects Collection

This repository is a curated collection of AI projects developed by Harsh Kumar Tyagi.  
It showcases real-world applications of machine learning, deep learning, and multimodal AI â€” from voice activity detection to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

Each project has its own dedicated folder with code, datasets (if applicable), and a README explaining its purpose, setup, and usage.
